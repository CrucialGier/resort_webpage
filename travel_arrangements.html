    <h3>As Bodufolhudhoo is an island surrounded by sea, transport is   mainly based on sea. There are speed boats and normal boats that people use for transport between islands.<br>
    Larger vessels are used to travel to and from the Capital Male' and for faster transport residents use seaplane service from the nearby resorts. Fishermen use specially designed vessels to catch fish from the open sea.<br> The government ferry system was introduced in 2012, whereby boats were available to travel between the islands on a cheaper fare.<br>

    People mostly walk in island, but use bicycles and motorbikes to drive from one place to another. Wheelbarrow "gaadiyaa" in different sizes are used to transport heavy materials.<br>

    In the early 1990s nationwide helicopter service was provided by Hummingbird. To this day Helipad used by Hummingbird exists in Bodufolhudhoo.
