    <h2>Hades' Abode</h2>
    <h3>The trip originates at the gate of death. Since departures are made daily, you are called upon to begin your trip on short notice. Since the journey is only one way, there is no need to concern yourself with return plans.<br>Your initial point of departure may prove more than a little frightening, as you suddenly realize the finality of your destination. The trip itself will leave you with little time to contemplate what awaits.<br>As you pass through the doorway of death, you will notice almost immediately that your direction is taking you away from the light toward what appears to be complete and utter darkness. With each passing moment the darkness becomes more intense. At first the absence of light is only annoying, but you feel it becoming more ominous and threatening.

    <h2>Place for People We Like</h2>
    <h3>You may have noticed that The Four Seasons Bora Bora hosted us while in Bora Bora and it was a dream! It’s been on my bucket list for sooo long and I’m so happy we finally got to go. <br> Four Seasons is for sure a luxury resort and it’s not the kind of place we would ever go spontaneously or on a whim, its moreso the kind of vacation you plan for a while and save up for. <br>Especially since not only is it a luxury resort but you just can’t find cheap flights there, I would say if you’re leaving from the states you won’t pay less than 1,500 per person and that would be a very good deal! But you absolutely get what you pay for, it is so unbelievably nice and the staff/service is the best we have had. Most people there were on their honeymoon, babymoon, anniversary, getting married there (they have a wedding almost every day of the week there!!) etc.<br> We stayed in an over the water bungalow with glass bottom windows. The view was honestly overwhelming it was so pretty. It was so nice to stay at a resort where you feel like you’re on vacation when you are in your room or back porch. <br>Most of our vacations I would feel guilty laying around because there are so many things to go see but here you can lounge and everywhere you are lounging has the best views EVER!
